# TS Pizza App Cliche

A small TypeScript demo project implementing a pizza menu and simple order handling.

Quick start

1.  Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2.  Build the TypeScript source into the `dist` folder:

```powershell
npm run build
```

3.  Serve the project with a static server and open `index.html` in your browser.
    - Use the Live Server extension in VS Code, or serve the `dist` folder with any static server.

Development

- Run a watcher that recompiles on file changes:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes

- The `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`, `dist`, editor settings and log files.
- `dist/index.js` is the compiled output; browsers cannot execute `.ts` files directly.
